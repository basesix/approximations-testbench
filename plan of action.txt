Approximations test Bench plan of action:

Description: The goal of the approximations test bench is to have a way of testing multiple approximation
methods on different data sets and visualizing the results with a small set of simple plots.

0.1 release:
Initial goals (Finished!): Set up a HTML dashboard for visuaizing an approximation on a simple set of data. Approximations
will be generated with a single input and output dimension, in the form y = f(x). Set up an approximation, a chart,
and a data set.

Approximations set up:
-Least-squares polynomial regression
-RBF interpolation (Gaussian basis function)

Added some 1-D data sets.

Next goals:
Charing goals:
-2-D contour plot
-Scatter/line /w uncertainty?
Error plots?

Approximation goals:
-Add a decision tree approximation
-Add an ensemble version of the decision tree
-Add kriging
-Add a radial basis network

Design goals:
-Add a settings panel for the approximations
-Move approximation computation to a web worker. Have a status for the approximations /w indicators on the approx lines.
