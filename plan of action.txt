Approximations test Bench plan of action:

Description: The goal of the approximations test bench is to have a way of testing multiple approximation
methods on different data sets and visualizing the results with a small set of simple plots.

Initial goals: Set up a HTML dashboard for visuaizing an approximation on a simple set of data. Approximations
will be generated with a single input and output dimension, in the form y = f(x). Set up an approximation, a chart,
and a data set.

Next goals:
-Add a 2-D approximation option w. 2-D plot
-
